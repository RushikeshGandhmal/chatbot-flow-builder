# React Flow Task [live demo](https://chatbot-flow-builder-dun.vercel.app/)

This project is a simple React application built with [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) and next.js . It demonstrates the implementation of drag and drop nodes with the ability to connect them. The state of the nodes and their connections can be saved and restored.

## Features

1. **Text Node** 
    1. There can be multiple Text Nodes in one flow.
    2. Nodes are added to the flow by dragging and dropping a Node from the Nodes Panel.
2. **Nodes Panel** 
    1. This panel houses all kind of Nodes that our Flow Builder supports.
    2. Right now there is only Message Node, but weâ€™d be adding more types of Nodes in the future so make this section extensible 
3. **Edge**
    1. Connects two Nodes together
4. **Source Handle**
    1. Source of a connecting edge 
    2. Can only have **one edge** originating from a source handle
5. **Target Handle** 
    1. Target of a connecting edge
    2. Can have **more than one edge** connecting to a target handle 
6. **Settings Panel**
   1. Settings Panel will replace the Nodes Panel when a Node is selected
   2. It has a text field to edit text of the selected Text Node
7. **Save Button**
    1. Button to save the flow 
    2. **Save button press will show an error if there are more than one Nodes and more than one Node has empty target handles**
